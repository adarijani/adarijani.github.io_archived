# UNDER CONSTRUCTION AND STUFF ARE BEING INCREMENTALLY ADDED

### Caution!

The [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) is a rapidly changing field. I only update the materials in every iteration I do and therefore it is best to consult multiple sources.

### [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux)

The world of [High-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) is dominated by [Supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) that 
have a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) therefore a bit of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is kind of a [De facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) standard.  
I suggest that you check some materials beforehand to save yourself from the agony and suffering of not knowing it during the [High-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) course.
