# [Popular Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science)
I was in my second year at [SUT](https://en.sharif.edu/) where I got lucky and took a course with [Mir Abbas Jalali](https://sites.google.com/site/mirabbasjalali/home?pli=1) and got exposed to the idea of [Popular Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_science) and [Science Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_communication). Getting to know the practitionerers like [Carl Sagan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), [Neil deGrasse Tyson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_deGrasse_Tyson), [Walter Lewin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Lewin) and many others was joyful. When I got graduated I decided to put a small effort into that direction and founded [Tara School](https://adarijani.github.io/projects/2_project/) in my ancestral home.

## Implementation
The general idea is to [implicitly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_learning) teach our students science in a fun way. The focus is mostly on [mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_proof) and in turn [logical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_logic) thinking. We rely 
heavily on [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_puzzle) and [brain teasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_teaser) and trying to get them to compete eachother in the said [games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_puzzle) and [brain teasers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_teaser). What games and What concepts? you might say...Well keep on reading to find out!!!
