Welcome to my personal web page! My name is Mohammadamin Darijani and I am a health professional with a doctorate degree in dentistry. My passion for improving public health and exploring the intersection of healthcare and technology has led me to develop an interest in digital health.

Throughout my career, I have been dedicated to promoting oral health and reducing oral health inequality. As a dentist, I have seen firsthand the impact of socioeconomic determinants on oral health and the challenges faced by marginalized and vulnerable populations. I believe that digital health has the potential to play a transformative role in addressing these issues and improving overall health outcomes.

On this page, I share my thoughts and experiences related to digital health and its applications in public health and dentistry. I also provide resources and information on oral health and the importance of preventative care. Thank you for visiting and I hope you find this page informative and helpful.
